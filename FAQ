Q. Why does my build still depend on old tasks?

A. Remember that if a task *fails* we can't be sure that it hasn't omitted a
dependency. (A "deps complete" would help this but for now...) So if a task
fails, dependencies won't be removed from the graph. Get the task to succeed
and they'll go away.
